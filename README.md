# Building-a-regression-model-to-predict-automobile-prices-using-Azure-Machine-Learning-Designer
Agenda:

1.Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

2.Set up compute clusters for model training

3.Explore and transform the dataset for optimal results

4.Train a regression model to predict automobile prices

5.Evaluate the model's performance using key metrics

6.Create an inference pipeline for real-time price prediction

7.Deploy the trained model as a web service using Azure Container Instance
